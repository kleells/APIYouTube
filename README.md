A coding tutorial created to review and practice basic JavaScript by creating a question and answer game. Completed through Mammoth Interactive at [link to Mammoth Interactive Homepage](https://training.mammothinteractive.com/courses).

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Dependencies
None. Viewer only needs to utilize Live Server through the index.html file.

## Uses
Add user functionality with JavaScript to an HTML. A small amount of Bootsrap and even less CSS were used in this project. I also used this project to focus on the structure of my JS file. Trying to create consistent line breaks, use of quotation marks, etc.

## How I veered from the original project
-  the look of the landing page

## History
After completing a Software Engineering certification program and during my job search, I needed to continue to pracitce my skill set in order to maintain it and learn more. I thought that even the most basic projects using the most basic languages was a great place to start.
